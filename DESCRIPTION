Package: usmapdata
Title: Mapping Data for 'usmap' Package
Version: 0.1.2.9999
Description: Provides a container for data used by the 'usmap' package.
    The data used by 'usmap' has been extracted into this package so that the
    file size of the 'usmap' package can be reduced greatly. The data in this
    package will be updated roughly once per year (plus bug fixes) as new
    shape files are provided by the US Census bureau.
